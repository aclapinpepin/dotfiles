# Dotfiles
This is a collection of my dotfiles.

## Used libraries
* [Exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa)
(have to remove the la alias in ~/.oh_my_zsh/lib/directories.zsh)

## To-Do
* Write script to automate setup of a new machine

* Always run `brew install reattach-to-user-namespace`

### After installing packages
* Run Vim-plug in vim
* Run zplug in zsh

### Packages and stuff to consider in script
* [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug) | Install manually and not from Homebrew so that you can manage the instalation
  directory
* Exa (see above)
* [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
* [ack](https://beyondgrep.com/install/)
* consider using [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf)
